This is an excellent strategic question. Let me help you think through this systematically.
The Key Question:

Is "experience-driven requirements" just a conceptual lens (how you think about it), or should it fundamentally shape your data model and user interface?
My Analysis:
Option A: Keep Current Design (Narrow Path)

Your current thinking:

Submission → AI Processing → Requirements
```

**Works if:**
- ✅ Stakeholders are already good at articulating clear needs
- ✅ You're solving "feature request management" problem
- ✅ Context is handled informally (conversations, meetings)
- ✅ Tool is just for **tracking and translation**

**Risk:**
- ❌ Loses rich context that makes requirements meaningful
- ❌ "Garbage in, garbage out" - vague submissions = vague requirements
- ❌ Can't distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- ❌ Misses your unique value proposition

### Option B: Experience-First Design (Broader Narrative)
**Redesigned approach:**
```
Experience/Narrative → Context Extraction → Requirement Generation → Linked Trail

Advantage:

    ✅ Captures WHY not just WHAT
    ✅ AI can do richer analysis with more context
    ✅ Traceability: requirement → experience → stakeholder
    ✅ Pattern detection across experiences
    ✅ Differentiates your tool from Jira/Linear
    ✅ Builds organizational knowledge base

Works if:

    Your vision includes helping teams understand users deeply
    You want to solve "lost context" problem in requirements
    AI analysis benefits from richer input

Design Thinking Perspective:

Traditional requirements tools fail because:

    They focus on WHAT (features) not WHY (user needs)
    Context gets lost in translation
    They're transactional, not narrative

Your opportunity: If you embrace experience-driven design, you're building something closer to:

    User research repository + Requirements management
    Empathy preservation system + Translation tool
    Knowledge management + Agile workflow

This is significantly more valuable and defensible.
Data Model Comparison:
Current (Narrow) Model:
sql

submissions
├── id
├── title
├── description
├── submitted_by
└── submitted_at

requirements (generated by AI)
├── id
├── submission_id (FK)
├── user_story
└── acceptance_criteria

Limitation: Thin input = thin output
Experience-Driven Model:
sql

experiences (the narrative)
├── id
├── stakeholder_id (FK)
├── narrative_text (rich, detailed story)
├── context_tags (environment, user type, etc.)
├── participants (who was involved)
├── pain_points (extracted or tagged)
├── current_workaround
├── impact_severity
├── emotional_indicators
└── submitted_at

experience_analysis (AI processing)
├── id
├── experience_id (FK)
├── extracted_goals
├── identified_obstacles
├── root_cause_hypothesis
├── related_experiences (pattern matching)
└── sentiment_analysis

requirements (synthesized)
├── id
├── requirement_text
├── why_statement (from experience)
├── priority
└── status

experience_requirement_link (traceability)
├── experience_id (FK)
├── requirement_id (FK)
└── relevance_score
```

**Benefit:** Rich input enables intelligent synthesis

## My Recommendation:

### **Change it now, but iterate gradually:**

**Why change now:**
1. **You're at MVP stage** - easiest time to pivot
2. **Data model changes are expensive later** - right time to get foundation right
3. **Your conceptual insight is valid** - the narrow path limits your tool's potential
4. **AI works better with context** - richer input = better output

**How to change pragmatically:**

### Phase 1 (MVP - Do This Now):
**Enhance the input form** to capture experience elements:
```
Instead of:
- Title: _______
- Description: _______

Do:
- What happened? (narrative field - more space, guidance)
- Who was affected? (user type/persona)
- What were they trying to do? (goal)
- What went wrong or was difficult? (obstacle)
- What was the impact? (business/user)
- Current workaround? (if any)

Update data model:
sql

experiences  -- rename from "submissions"
├── narrative (TEXT) -- rich, detailed
├── user_context (JSON) -- flexible metadata
├── goal_attempted
├── obstacle_encountered
├── impact_description
└── ... existing fields
```

**AI prompt changes:**
```
Instead of: "Convert this to a user story"

Do: "Analyze this user experience narrative. Extract:
- Core user goal
- Root problem (not symptom)
- Context factors
- Suggested requirement with WHY statement
- Links to similar patterns"

Phase 2 (Post-MVP):

    Pattern detection across experiences
    Experience clustering
    Multi-experience synthesis
    Rich querying ("show all checkout-related experiences")

Phase 3 (Future):

    Knowledge graph
    Advanced analytics
    Recommendation engine

Practical Implementation Strategy:

This week:

    ✅ Redesign input form (richer narrative capture)
    ✅ Update database schema (experiences not submissions)
    ✅ Enhance AI prompts (context-aware processing)

Keep simple:

    Don't over-engineer
    Start with text fields and basic structure
    Let AI do heavy lifting on extraction

Preserve flexibility:

    Use JSON fields for evolving metadata
    Don't lock into rigid taxonomy yet
    Learn from user behavior

The Litmus Test:

Ask yourself: "If a stakeholder submits an experience, can someone reading the generated requirement 6 months later understand WHY it matters?"

    Current narrow model: Probably not
    Experience-driven model: Yes, with full traceability

My Verdict:

Change it now. Here's why:

    ✅ Conceptually correct - aligns with how good requirements work
    ✅ Technically feasible - not much more complex
    ✅ Competitive advantage - differentiates from existing tools
    ✅ AI-friendly - better input = better output
    ✅ Timing right - pre-MVP is when to fix foundations

But keep it pragmatic:

    Don't build everything at once
    Start with richer input form + better data model
    Iterate AI processing based on real data
    Add pattern detection later

Next Steps:

Want me to:

    Redesign the data model with experience-first approach?
    Create an enhanced input form that captures narrative + context?
    Update the AI integration approach for experience analysis?
    Show migration path from current to new model?

This is a pivot worth making. The narrow path gets you a "Jira clone with AI." The experience-driven path gets you something genuinely innovative.
