# Experience-Driven Requirements: Complete UX Flow

## Overview: The Journey from Experience to Execution

```
Experience Capture → AI Analysis → Requirement Generation → Work Breakdown → Test Criteria → Backlog
```

---

## PHASE 1: Experience Capture

### Step 1.1: Landing & Context Setting
**Screen: "Share a User Experience"**

```
Welcome Message:
"Help us understand what users are experiencing. Share a story about a real 
situation—what happened, who was involved, and why it mattered."

Guidance:
"The richer the context you provide, the better we can translate this into 
actionable requirements."
```

### Step 1.2: Guided Narrative Capture

**Form Structure (Progressive Disclosure):**

```
Section 1: The Experience
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 Tell us the story
[Large text area - 500+ characters encouraged]

Prompt: "Describe what happened. Who was involved? What were they 
trying to accomplish? What went wrong or was difficult?"

Examples shown:
✓ "During our last sprint review, the product owner struggled to..."
✓ "A customer support rep told me about a user who spent 20 minutes..."
✓ "In user testing, we observed three participants attempting to..."


Section 2: The People Involved
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

👤 Who experienced this?
[ ] End User    [ ] Internal Team    [ ] Customer    [ ] Stakeholder
[ ] Other: _________

User Type/Persona (if known):
[Dropdown or free text: e.g., "Power User", "Casual User", "Admin"]

🎯 What were they trying to achieve?
[Text field - the goal/intent]


Section 3: The Problem
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚧 What obstacle did they encounter?
[Text area]

Current Workaround (if any):
[Text field - how do they cope now?]

💥 Impact & Consequences
[Text area - business impact, user frustration, time wasted, etc.]

Severity:
( ) Low - Minor inconvenience
( ) Medium - Significant friction
( ) High - Blocker or major pain point
( ) Critical - Business/user impact


Section 4: Context & Environment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Where/when did this happen?
[Text field - e.g., "During checkout", "In mobile app", "During peak hours"]

🏷️ Tags (optional)
[Multi-select or free tags: e.g., "checkout", "mobile", "performance"]

📎 Supporting Materials (optional)
[File upload - screenshots, recordings, documents]
```

### Step 1.3: Review & Submit

**Preview Screen:**
- Shows formatted narrative
- AI-generated summary preview (real-time): "This appears to be about [X user type] struggling with [Y goal] due to [Z obstacle]"
- Confidence indicators
- "Does this summary capture your experience?" [Yes/Needs adjustment]

**Actions:**
- [Save as Draft]
- [Submit for Analysis]

---

## PHASE 2: AI Analysis & Processing

### Step 2.1: Automated Analysis (Background)

**What AI Does:**

1. **Extract Key Elements:**
   - User goals
   - Pain points
   - Root causes (vs symptoms)
   - Context factors
   - Emotional/impact indicators

2. **Pattern Detection:**
   - "This is similar to 3 other experiences about checkout flow"
   - "Related to existing requirement REQ-042"

3. **Generate Initial Artifacts:**
   - Problem statement
   - Suggested requirements
   - Potential solutions
   - Test scenarios (from real experience)

### Step 2.2: Analysis Results (Notification)

**Email/Dashboard Alert:**
```
✅ Experience EXP-123 has been analyzed

Key Findings:
• Identified goal: User trying to export data for compliance reporting
• Root cause: No bulk export feature, forcing manual copy-paste
• Impact: 2+ hours wasted per week per user
• Related to: EXP-087, EXP-099 (similar export pain points)

## PHASE 7: Implementation & Validation

### Step 7.1: During Development

**Developer View:**
```
Currently working on: STORY-1 (Basic Bulk Export)

LINKED CONTEXT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📖 Read the original experiences that drove this work:
   → EXP-123, EXP-087, EXP-099

🎯 Remember why this matters:
   "Product owner currently spends 2+ hours manually copying data
    for compliance reports..."

💡 Design notes from experience:
   • Users expect Excel format specifically (compliance requirement)
   • Must handle 5,000+ records (real-world volume)
   • Network reliability is an issue (add retry logic)

## KEY UX PRINCIPLES Throughout:

### 1. **Preserve Context Always**
Every screen shows link back to original experience(s)

### 2. **Traceability is Visible**
Users can always see: Experience → Requirement → Work → Tests → Outcome

### 3. **AI as Collaborator, Not Dictator**
AI suggests, humans decide and refine

### 4. **Narrative Remains Central**
Original stories are never buried—they're referenced throughout

### 5. **Validation Closes the Loop**
Circle back to original stakeholders to confirm problem solved

### 6. **Learning & Iteration**
New experiences inform future work, creating continuous improvement

## Mobile-Responsive Considerations

For stakeholders submitting experiences on the go:

- **Voice-to-text support** for narrative capture
- **Quick capture mode** (minimal fields, expand later)
- **Photo/video uploads** for context
- **Offline mode** (sync when connected)

---

## Accessibility Features

- **Screen reader optimized** narrative flows
- **Keyboard navigation** for all functions
- **High contrast mode** for visual impairment
- **Plain language** option (reduce technical jargon)

---

## This Flow Achieves:

✅ **Honors the experience-driven philosophy**
✅ **Maintains context from capture to deployment**
✅ **Enables AI to add value without losing human insight**
✅ **Creates full traceability**
✅ **Validates solutions against original problems**
✅ **Builds organizational learning**
✅ **Supports collaborative refinement**
✅ **Measures real impact**

The key differentiator: **Every requirement knows its story**.
